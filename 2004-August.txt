Message-ID: <200408030118.38579.ingo.hinrichs@web.de>

Hi All,

I setup the build system based on automake/autoconf (not completed yet).
But, if someone want to compile try:

aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf
./configure
make
make install

If you have trouble with the libtool try 'libtoolize' before calling automake.

Thanks, Ingo!

I only have replaced AC_CONFIG_HEADER with AM_CONFIG_HEADER, my
automake choked on the first one and the doc says AM_ is preferred when
using automake.

After this (and of course updating automake/autoconf...) it worked.

Subject: [Sigschege-devel] text size
Message-ID: <20040803215313.GA9594@localhost>

Hi,

FYI, some info from Brian Smith, the xfig/transfig developer: 

=========

>2. If I export a file to eps, I see that it does a "scalefont 180". But
>the right value should be 200, as it is 12*1200/72.
>For previous discussions please see also:
>http://www.freetype.org/pipermail/freetype/2004-July/007226.html

This was done for historical reasons, but xfig 3.2.5-alpha (actually fig2dev
3.2.5-alpha) uses the true font sizes now.
You can get both xfig and fig2dev from ftp://epb.lbl.gov/xfig/alpha

==========

Basically this means, the text size fix must be switched on for
transfig <= 3.2.4, off for newer versions.

Hi,

here are some hints to get you faster into the debug flow...

Don't forget to switch off optimization:
CXX=-g ./configure

To start gdb:
libtool --mode=execute gdb Example

After too much time investigating the issue I found the problem why
the library symbols won't work: they aren't simply loaded yet...

To do so, simply set a breakpoint on main and run the program.
Afterwards the EasyVec symbols are at your service!


One final note:

For the completion to work properly, you must quote class members in
gdb with a single quote ': 
b 'EasyVecElmText::up<TAB>


Cheers,
Ulf

Should be "CXXFLAGS=-g ./configure" of course.

Subject: [Sigschege-devel] EasyVec Usage...
Message-ID: <20040821122646.GA4672@localhost>

Hi,

to see faster results in the demo programs, you can instead of saving
the figure with "save" directly export it to postscript:

pic1.export_fig2dev("eps", "test_a_pic1_a.eps");

Of course other formats supported by fig2dev should also work,
eg. jpeg or pdf. ("fig2dev -L french" prints a list.)

If you have a transfig version before 3.2.5alpha you may need to
activate the font fix:

EasyVecElmText::fig2dev_fontfix(true);


Cheers,
Ulf

Subject: [Sigschege-devel] Polymorphism...
Message-ID: <20040821133648.GA1385@localhost>

Hi,

I'm just working on the polymorphism of EasyVec...

What I need is a way to tell the types of EasyVecElm objects.

This will be needed for accessing elements returned by an EasyVec
figure.

As long as you remember an object with a pointer, there's no problem:
EasyVecElmText *ctxt = pic1.text();

But the problem pops up, when you for example want to search for a text:

vector<EasyVecElmText *> texts;

texts = pic1.findText("*changed*");


It seems that there is no automatic way to get the type of an object
in C++. Although the compiler itself knows it (thanks to the vptr), it
won't tell me.

Is there a way to 4do this in C++?

If not I will just add a virtual "type" function that returns the
element type... 

if (ctxt->type() == Text) {
  // bla...
}  

AFAIR the values of an enum are globally visible, so I should use some
more precise name...


???
Ulf

Hi, 
 I think there is no automatic way in C++.

I use a methode like the one your already described...

cheers,
