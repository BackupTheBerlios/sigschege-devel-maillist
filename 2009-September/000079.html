</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should think about a manager to handle all different visualization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mappings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have ideas, please write them down.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The principle is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> * Each state is defined as a string, nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i> * A visualization scheme defines what the state (not the event actually)
</I>&gt;<i> looks like and is attached to a signal This includes lines (top, middle,
</I>&gt;<i> bottom, several of them), text (eg. display the state), colours * at least
</I>&gt;<i> 2 standard visualization schemes exist:
</I>&gt;<i>   - &quot;logic&quot;: 1/0 are displayed as top/bottom lines, X/U as both lines, Z as
</I>&gt;<i> middle line, no text is displayed - &quot;bus&quot;: all states are displayed with
</I>&gt;<i> top/bottom line, text is always displayed * user defined visualization
</I>&gt;<i> schemes are possible, not now, but later
</I>
I think I understand. If the string is &#8216;1&#8217; then it will be shown as a 
high signal and if the string is &#8216;0&#8217; if will be shown as a low signal, 
right?

What should we do if I want green and red high signals at the same time? 
And both should show the text &#8216;1&#8217; (to make it harder :-). I know its 
future use, but think about it. Using only strings to define a state 
will limit us a lot. In the end we need more information about a state.

&gt;<i> For the events, in the easiest implementation they just connect the lines,
</I>&gt;<i> which could also be &quot;from bottom line to middle AND bottom line&quot;. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> later they will be extended for more fancy stuff, like colour transition,
</I>&gt;<i> jitter, etc... and right now we also need slopes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just checked the code and saw that you draw not only the event, but also
</I>&gt;<i> the state itself (if I interpreted it correctly). I assume it's the signal
</I>&gt;<i> state before the event. In an extreme case there might even be no event at
</I>&gt;<i> all, but we could solve that by mirroring the t=-infinity event (which we
</I>&gt;<i> need anyway for the start value) to a t=+infinity event (actually we just
</I>&gt;<i> mirror the last event to +infinity).
</I>

Almost right :-)

An event starts at the event time, eg. 10ns and ends at the next event 
or never (it will end at the end of the timing diagram). It will draw 
the state transition and the following state which is defined in the event.

Another important point is that TimWave has 1 or more events. So, there 
is at least one event. This event can have the type NULL or Empty which 
does not draw anything but occupies space (up the next event or the end 
of the timing diagram). Note that this event type is not implemented yet.

All events are stored in a double linked list that can be manipulated by 
the event themselves. They can remove themselves from the list or insert 
a new event. This simplifies the implementation user interactions.

&gt;<i> &gt; I thinks it would be better to make a event a graphic item. It will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simplify the implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to know, why do you want that TimWave draws the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signal. What are the benefits?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because I love my existing code. :P
</I>&gt;<i> Well actually it doesn't really matter where we do the actual calculations,
</I>&gt;<i> as long as the Event knows the starting conditions (end time and state of
</I>&gt;<i> previous event).
</I>&gt;<i> But the Low/High classes are not flexible enough even to handle all
</I>&gt;<i> possible state transitions, and don't bring enough benefit to pour them
</I>&gt;<i> into classes of their own, so there should be only one Event, which is
</I>&gt;<i> clever enough to handle all possible transitions.
</I>
First of all, the current TimEventHigh/Low classes are very simple 
implementation. The current implementation is the absolute minimum that 
we need to support simple high and low states. As I sad before, we have 
a lot to do :-)

But let me explain my idea a little bit further.

Now would be good time to fetch a new coffee or tee.

Done? Ok, let&#8217;s start&#8230;

&#183; TimWave has 1...n TimEvents

&#183; TimEvents are stored in a double linked list

&#183; Each TimEvent is responsible from the event (time) to the next event 
or end of timing diagram

&#183; Each TimEvent has the same information.

o Pointer to some timing diagram wide information

o Pointer to a TimEventType object

o Event time

o String (not yet)

o Slope (not yet)

o Etc. (not yet)

&#183; TimEvent will not draw anything, it will only store information

&#183; Subclasses of TimEventType will be responsible for the screen 
representation (drawing) and everything else that is state related

&#183; TimEventLow is a subclass of TimEventType and only responsible to draw 
low signals (state transitions and state)

&#183; TimEventHigh is a subclass of TimEventType and only responsible to 
draw high signals (state transitions and state)

&#183; TimEventType (and subclasses) and TimEvent are using the state design 
pattern. This means that TimEvent will change its behaviour by changing 
the TimEventType pointer. For example: To change a high event to a low 
event the TimEventType pointer must be changed from TimEventHigh to 
TimEventLow.

&#183; We can use the Flyweight pattern to collect all subclasses of 
TimEventType in one manager. (not implemented yet)
This would allow us to have different types or different configurations 
of high signals.

&#183; Using these patterns will give us a lot of freedom. We can add new 
states without a lot of rework. It will separate the implementation of 
different states. This will be much easier to implement, to change, to 
test and to debug.

&gt;<i> If you agree with this I could proceed by implementing a visualization
</I>&gt;<i> scheme class and then rework the Event class).
</I>
I think we are not so far away from each other. In the end we try to 
achieve the same thing, but we are using different designs.

Please think carefully about the design options because it will 
influence Sigschege a lot. I&#8217;m pretty sure that the &#8220;string state&#8221; and 
visualization scheme will work, but I fear that it will limit our 
freedom in the future.

My design idea would give us much more freedom. These design patterns 
are used a lot in many applications and frameworks, and I think we 
should do the same.
