Hi Ingo,

Am Monday 21 September 2009 12:21:28 schrieb Development discussions:

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I understand. If the string is &#8216;1&#8217; then it will be shown as a 
</I>&gt;<i> high signal and if the string is &#8216;0&#8217; if will be shown as a low signal, 
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>
If you use the builtin &quot;logic&quot; visualization, yes.
If you use the builtin &quot;bus&quot; visualization, no. In that case both would be displayed
as &quot;X&quot; (bottom and top line) with the text &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot; displayed.
If you use a custom visualization, it might look like...whatever.

&gt;<i> What should we do if I want green and red high signals at the same time? 
</I>&gt;<i> And both should show the text &#8216;1&#8217; (to make it harder :-). I know its 
</I>&gt;<i> future use, but think about it. Using only strings to define a state 
</I>&gt;<i> will limit us a lot. In the end we need more information about a state.
</I>
First of all, for Sigschege there is no &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; signals at all, just some
states which are represented with a line at the top or at the bottom (admittedly
not a rare case.

Basically states are nothing else then the &quot;TimEvent&quot; Objects, they could easily be enhanced
later to carry additional information.
If something like different colors with the same printed value should ever be needed, 
it would be easy to add something like &quot;properties&quot;, eg &quot;1:red&quot; and &quot;1:green&quot;.


&gt;<i> An event starts at the event time, eg. 10ns and ends at the next event 
</I>&gt;<i> or never (it will end at the end of the timing diagram). It will draw 
</I>&gt;<i> the state transition and the following state which is defined in the event.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another important point is that TimWave has 1 or more events. So, there 
</I>&gt;<i> is at least one event. This event can have the type NULL or Empty which 
</I>&gt;<i> does not draw anything but occupies space (up the next event or the end 
</I>&gt;<i> of the timing diagram). Note that this event type is not implemented yet.
</I>
OK. But to make it simpler: If the pointer to next is NULL, the end time of the state
is automatically regarded as +infinity, if the pointer to prev is NULL, the start
time is -infinity (i.e. it's the start state). There might be a NULL visualization though
in case for certain time slots nothing should be drawn.

&gt;<i> First of all, the current TimEventHigh/Low classes are very simple 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation. The current implementation is the absolute minimum that 
</I>&gt;<i> we need to support simple high and low states. As I sad before, we have 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot to do :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But let me explain my idea a little bit further.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now would be good time to fetch a new coffee or tee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Done? Ok, let&#8217;s start&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; TimWave has 1...n TimEvents
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; TimEvents are stored in a double linked list
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Each TimEvent is responsible from the event (time) to the next event 
</I>&gt;<i> or end of timing diagram
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Each TimEvent has the same information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o Pointer to some timing diagram wide information
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o Pointer to a TimEventType object
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o Event time
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o String (not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o Slope (not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> o Etc. (not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; TimEvent will not draw anything, it will only store information
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Subclasses of TimEventType will be responsible for the screen 
</I>&gt;<i> representation (drawing) and everything else that is state related
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; TimEventLow is a subclass of TimEventType and only responsible to draw 
</I>&gt;<i> low signals (state transitions and state)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; TimEventHigh is a subclass of TimEventType and only responsible to 
</I>&gt;<i> draw high signals (state transitions and state)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; TimEventType (and subclasses) and TimEvent are using the state design 
</I>&gt;<i> pattern. This means that TimEvent will change its behaviour by changing 
</I>&gt;<i> the TimEventType pointer. For example: To change a high event to a low 
</I>&gt;<i> event the TimEventType pointer must be changed from TimEventHigh to 
</I>&gt;<i> TimEventLow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
OK, I understand what you want and I think it should work, but might have some pitfalls. 

o You basically merged State and Event into one class  (that's ok for me).
o with this concept you would need at least the following EventType classes:
- Low (line at the bottom)
- High (line at the top)
- Middle (line in the middle)
- X (lines at top and bottom)
- as less rare occurrence states with bottom/middle, top/middle lines
- as a special case multi-level lines, eg. for displaying a voltage from 0 to 5 in 500 mV steps, which requires 11 possible lines :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please think carefully about the design options because it will 
</I>&gt;<i> influence Sigschege a lot. I&#8217;m pretty sure that the &#8220;string state&#8221; and 
</I>&gt;<i> visualization scheme will work, but I fear that it will limit our 
</I>&gt;<i> freedom in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My design idea would give us much more freedom. These design patterns 
</I>&gt;<i> are used a lot in many applications and frameworks, and I think we 
</I>&gt;<i> should do the same.
</I>
I don't have a complete understanding of these patterns yet, but isn't it a bit of overhead to exchange a complete
object, instead of just setting one variable from &quot;draw it at the top&quot; to &quot;draw it in the middle&quot;?

Cheers,
Ulf
