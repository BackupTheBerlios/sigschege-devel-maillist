Hi Ingo,

Sure. :)

The principle is as follows:
* Each state is defined as a string, nothing else.
* A visualization scheme defines what the state (not the event actually) looks like and is attached to a signal
  This includes lines (top, middle, bottom, several of them), text (eg. display the state), colours
* at least 2 standard visualization schemes exist:
  - &quot;logic&quot;: 1/0 are displayed as top/bottom lines, X/U as both lines, Z as middle line, no text is displayed
  - &quot;bus&quot;: all states are displayed with top/bottom line, text is always displayed
* user defined visualization schemes are possible, not now, but later

For the events, in the easiest implementation they just connect the lines, which could also be &quot;from bottom
line to middle AND bottom line&quot;. Maybe later they will be extended for more fancy stuff, like colour transition,
jitter, etc... and right now we also need slopes.

I just checked the code and saw that you draw not only the event, but also the state itself (if I interpreted
it correctly). I assume it's the signal state before the event. In an extreme case there might even be
no event at all, but we could solve that by mirroring the t=-infinity event (which we need anyway for the start value)
to a t=+infinity event (actually we just mirror the last event to +infinity).


&gt;<i> I thinks it would be better to make a event a graphic item. It will simplify 
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to know, why do you want that TimWave draws the whole signal. 
</I>&gt;<i> What are the benefits?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Because I love my existing code. :P
Well actually it doesn't really matter where we do the actual calculations, as long as the Event knows the starting conditions 
(end time and state of previous event).
But the Low/High classes are not flexible enough even to handle all possible state transitions,
and don't bring enough benefit to pour them into classes of their own, so there should be only one Event, which
is clever enough to handle all possible transitions.

If you agree with this I could proceed by implementing a visualization scheme class and then rework the Event class).

Cheers,
Ulf

PS: Huh? I just wanted to send the mail and Kmail told me: 
&quot;The message you have composed seems to refer to an attached file but you have not attached anything.
Do you want to attach a file to your message?&quot;
