<PRE>Hi Ulf,

&gt;<i>Hi Ingo,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I found the time to have a first glance at your code. Generally I agree with 
</I>&gt;<i>that approach,
</I>&gt;<i>with the following exceptions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* no tabs please!
</I>
No problem, my editor was miss configured. I fixed it and updated the files.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* classes like &quot;EventLow/High&quot; are too specialized and go in the wrong 
</I>&gt;<i>direction. Sigschege
</I>&gt;<i>will have a generic concept of states/transitions and define visualization 
</I>&gt;<i>mappings for those. 
</I>&gt;<i>Visualization mappings define how a state is displayed (with/without text 
</I>&gt;<i>label, lines on top,
</I>&gt;<i>at the bottom or in the middle, colour, etc) and can be per-signal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually, TimEventLow and TimEventHigh are only responsible for drawing. All 
event data like, time, text etc, are stored in TimEvent. So, if you want, 
TimEvent is a generic event and TimEventLow/High are the &#8220;visualization 
mappings&#8221;. If I understand you correct, you want only one highly configurable 
class that does the drawings.

I don't know if this is a good idea (I need to think a little bit more about 
that) but I think it can be easily implemented by sub-classing TimEventType 
and use this new class instead of TimEventLow/High. Maybe we should think 
about a manager to handle all different visualization mappings. 

If you have ideas, please write them down.....

&gt;<i>* the drawing of events, and actually the whole signal, should be done by the 
</I>&gt;<i>TimWave class.
</I>
Do you really think that this is a good idea. I know, it would work, but then 
we have to implement everything on our own. I mean, every time when the user 
clicks, we have to figure out which event was meant. And as soon as other 
elements, like Arrows, depend on a event, we have to calculate the position 
very often.

Why not simply implement events as graphic items. In such a case, Qt figures 
out which event was meant by a click. Handling &#8220;Event relation arrows&#8221; would 
be easier too. They could ask the event for their position (without difficult 
calculations).

I thinks it would be better to make a event a graphic item. It will simplify 
the implementation.

I would like to know, why do you want that TimWave draws the whole signal. 
What are the benefits?

Cheers
Ingo

&gt;<i>As for the &quot;YaVec&quot; topic: In theory we could just implement &quot;export_svg&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>hierarchy next to the &quot;paint&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>functions. It wouldn't be a big problem, with one exception: code 
</I>&gt;<i>duplication. It doesn't matter
</I>&gt;<i>as long as the paint function simply is something like a simple drawLine or 
</I>&gt;<i>drawText, but if the paint
</I>&gt;<i>function does a lot of calculations we have to duplicate it. Have a look at 
</I>&gt;<i>TimSignal::paintRange in
</I>&gt;<i>the old implementation. Maybe it is possible to have a generic function and 
</I>&gt;<i>implement the actual
</I>&gt;<i>drawing in a callback function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hmmm.. maybe passing  a special object that delegates the painting might be a 
</I>&gt;<i>good idea?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I guess we have to think more about it...
</I>

Cheers,
Ulf

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi guys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was think a lot to find a good way for our Sigschege GUI. Like Ulf said 
</I>in a 
&gt;<i> &gt; previous post, we have two ways to implement the signal drawing. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.We draw everything by our self into a widget.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.We use QGraphicsView and QGraphicsScene and implement a  GarphicsItem 
</I>for 
&gt;<i> &gt; every element that we have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After some experiments I think we should go for option 2. The first way 
</I>would 
&gt;<i> &gt; be good for a waveform view. In our case it would be a nightmare because 
</I>we 
&gt;<i> &gt; have to calculate every mouse click  by our self. The same is true for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selection and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The second way would be much simpler. Qt handles all the calculations 
</I>(mouse 
&gt;<i> &gt; position) coordinate system conversions etc..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If no one has any objectives, I would like to check in my experimental 
</I>&#8220;simple 
&gt;<i> &gt; GUI&#8221;. It uses the second way, but need a lot of work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ingo
