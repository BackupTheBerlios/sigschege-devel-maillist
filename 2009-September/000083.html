</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What should we do if I want green and red high signals at the same time?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And both should show the text &#8216;1&#8217; (to make it harder :-). I know its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; future use, but think about it. Using only strings to define a state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will limit us a lot. In the end we need more information about a state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, for Sigschege there is no &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; signals at all,
</I>&gt;<i> just some states which are represented with a line at the top or at the
</I>&gt;<i> bottom (admittedly not a rare case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically states are nothing else then the &quot;TimEvent&quot; Objects, they could
</I>&gt;<i> easily be enhanced later to carry additional information.
</I>&gt;<i> If something like different colors with the same printed value should ever
</I>&gt;<i> be needed, it would be easy to add something like &quot;properties&quot;, eg &quot;1:red&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;1:green&quot;.
</I>
I know the the generic state design would work and I sure that we can 
change/add anything later. But, I think we should limit the feature list in 
the beginning, so that we can have something useful very soon. If we do it too 
flexible it will take us a long time....

&gt;<i> &gt; An event starts at the event time, eg. 10ns and ends at the next event
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or never (it will end at the end of the timing diagram). It will draw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the state transition and the following state which is defined in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another important point is that TimWave has 1 or more events. So, there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is at least one event. This event can have the type NULL or Empty which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not draw anything but occupies space (up the next event or the end
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the timing diagram). Note that this event type is not implemented yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. But to make it simpler: If the pointer to next is NULL, the end time of
</I>&gt;<i> the state is automatically regarded as +infinity, if the pointer to prev is
</I>&gt;<i> NULL, the start time is -infinity (i.e. it's the start state). There might
</I>&gt;<i> be a NULL visualization though in case for certain time slots nothing
</I>&gt;<i> should be drawn.
</I>
At the moment I'm limiting -inf and +inf to the start and end time of the 
TimingDiagram. It simplifies the calculations :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; First of all, the current TimEventHigh/Low classes are very simple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation. The current implementation is the absolute minimum that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we need to support simple high and low states. As I sad before, we have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot to do :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But let me explain my idea a little bit further.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now would be good time to fetch a new coffee or tee.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Done? Ok, let&#8217;s start&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; TimWave has 1...n TimEvents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; TimEvents are stored in a double linked list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; Each TimEvent is responsible from the event (time) to the next event
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or end of timing diagram
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; Each TimEvent has the same information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o Pointer to some timing diagram wide information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o Pointer to a TimEventType object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o Event time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o String (not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o Slope (not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o Etc. (not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; TimEvent will not draw anything, it will only store information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; Subclasses of TimEventType will be responsible for the screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; representation (drawing) and everything else that is state related
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; TimEventLow is a subclass of TimEventType and only responsible to draw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; low signals (state transitions and state)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; TimEventHigh is a subclass of TimEventType and only responsible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; draw high signals (state transitions and state)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183; TimEventType (and subclasses) and TimEvent are using the state design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pattern. This means that TimEvent will change its behaviour by changing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the TimEventType pointer. For example: To change a high event to a low
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event the TimEventType pointer must be changed from TimEventHigh to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TimEventLow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I understand what you want and I think it should work, but might have
</I>&gt;<i> some pitfalls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o You basically merged State and Event into one class  (that's ok for me).
</I>&gt;<i> o with this concept you would need at least the following EventType
</I>&gt;<i> classes: - Low (line at the bottom)
</I>&gt;<i> - High (line at the top)
</I>&gt;<i> - Middle (line in the middle)
</I>&gt;<i> - X (lines at top and bottom)
</I>&gt;<i> - as less rare occurrence states with bottom/middle, top/middle lines
</I>
Yep that is exactly right! But, we don't need to design them all at once. As 
soon as we have the infrastructure for TimEventLow/High it is a mater of 
adding additional classes. Maybe we can add a plug-in interface to make it 
extensible. Then the user can design it's own one :-)

In the end we have to implement the function anyway. Be it in one huge paint 
function or many small classes.

&gt;<i> - as a special case multi-level lines, eg. for displaying a voltage from 0
</I>&gt;<i> to 5 in 500 mV steps, which requires 11 possible lines :)
</I>
Hmmm, voltage steps! I think we should not use TimWave for this. Analog 
signals should have it's own class, but if we want to use TimWave with event, 
we could design a TimEventMultiLevel class that does exactly what you want.

&gt;<i> &gt; Please think carefully about the design options because it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; influence Sigschege a lot. I&#8217;m pretty sure that the &#8220;string state&#8221; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; visualization scheme will work, but I fear that it will limit our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; freedom in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My design idea would give us much more freedom. These design patterns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are used a lot in many applications and frameworks, and I think we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should do the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a complete understanding of these patterns yet, but isn't it a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of overhead to exchange a complete object, instead of just setting one
</I>&gt;<i> variable from &quot;draw it at the top&quot; to &quot;draw it in the middle&quot;?
</I>
At the moment, the overhead is the destruction of one class and the creation 
of another class (it's a simple implementation). If we use the Flyweight 
design pattern as well, it would become a simple pointer change since we can 
reuse objects. So the overhead would be the same as setting one variable from 
&quot;draw it at the top&quot; to &quot;draw it in the middle&quot;. 

The benefit would be that we separate the implementation. Otherwise we need a 
huge switch or if  statements. A plug-in interface would be very difficult in 
this case.
