Gentlemen,

please note that some of my commits in the near future are not compileable. I
will try to make this clear in the assorted commit message.

It seems, subversion doesn't like modifying and renaming a file in one
step. Since I don't know the consequences of that behaviour, I just do it in
subsequent commits...


Ciao,
Ulf

Hi,

please note that Berlios now supports Subversion 1.1.

It's surely worth updating, especially because of:

- Client follows renames (new client feature)
- Speed optimizations: (requires both new client and server)

I'll do it now. If you don't hear me scream during the next days it should be
safe... 


Ciao,
Ulf
