Hello Ulf

Happy New Year!!

I found the problem! I forgot to remove a delete from TimEvents destructor. As 
soon as the first signal was deleted, TimEventLow was deleted as well. This was 
bad because the TimEventTypes are now shared between all signals. As the new 
signal tried to draw itself, it tried to access the deleted TimEventLow.

Good finding!

Cheers
Ingo
