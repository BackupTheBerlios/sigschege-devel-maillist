Hey guys,

funny that you show up just now that I decided to finish my carreer as game programmer and continue to develop Sigschege...

Well, at least I made 3 small contributions to Nexuiz. :)

OK, my answers:

1. be careful, SVN is out of date, because I have some uncommitted modifications.

2. Ingo, can you send me the error message please?

3. GUI: a WxWidgets GUI for Sigschege exists. It does *nothing* except from *incorrectly* displaying the timing diagram, but it's started. :P

repeat:

4. As a preparation for the GUI I started defining a native file format and implemented saving/loading. It is based on XML.

5. As for the GUI, I don't think it should be based on Python. Even maintaining the Python interface sucks, because the object-oriented
C++ hierarchy has to be mirrored into an object-oriented Python-hierarchy. Just look at the current code. And then realize what's even missing now:
after loading a timing diagram it must be mirrored into the Python objects....

6. As for the toolkit, current code is wxWidgets, but I'd also be fine with qt4. The problem is that all the toolkits bring their own stuff, like string class 
(even unicode ones), and the question is how to handle that. (from what point on making it dependent from toolkit? convert to/from string? or wstring?)


In July I might have some short work and probably want to use a part of it to work on Sigschege. (Might also be shifted to September)

Cheers,
Ulf
