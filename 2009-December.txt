Subject: [Sigschege-devel] segfault
Message-ID: <1883795174@web.de>


Hi Ingo,

I'm seeing a segmentation fault which can be reproduced easily:

./sigschege
addTLI 0xa01d898 @-1     // me presses big green "+"
rmTLI 0xa01d898          // me presses Undo
addTLI 0x9ed40a0 @-1     // me presses big green "+"
TimCmdAddListItem: delete 0xa01d898
Segmentation fault

It seems that adding a new signal to the diagram after an undo deletes the
previous add-command from the undo stack and this causes the crash.

Removing "delete m_item" from the TimCmdAddListItem destructor fixes the
segfault, but actually I don't understand why. The documentation for
QGraphicsScene::removeItem explicitly says "The ownership of item is passed
on to the caller (i.e., QGraphicsScene will no longer delete item when destroyed)."

I looked at an example from Qt (/usr/lib/qt4/examples/tools/undoframework),
and indeed they do not delete the item when the add-command is deconstructed.
I think there isn't even a destructor.
