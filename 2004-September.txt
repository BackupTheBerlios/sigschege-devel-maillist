Hi Ingo,

I started adapting the Event class to the new scheme we discussed.

Although we discussed not to create an intermediate EventList class, since you
already had one ;-) I just used it for now. We can decide later if we use it or
rename it to Signal. 

I changed TimingMain, if yous start it with no argument or an "l" it will run
your layout test, as before. If you start it with "e" it will run the Event
class test.

BTW: This new pointer scheme has one disadvantage: If the application which uses
the class stores the pointer for later use and the event is removed in the
meantime that will lead to difficult bugs which are difficult to locate...
EasyVec basically has the same problem. But on the other hand this is very
efficient... 


Cheers,
Ulf

Hi,

I just had some vague thoughts about the nature of signals.
I have put a text below, and appended a picture. 

Maybe you can comment these outlines.

Ciao,
Ulf



* Event with a slope

A slope has the effect that the corresponding event has a duration.
It has three distinct time points: start, middle, end. A reference can be set
to each of these points or to a percentage. 

If the event itself refers to another event, the delay is counted to the start.

* Uncertainty

An uncertainty also puts a duration on the event. Events which reference an
event with an uncertainty will inherit this uncertainty. 

* Visuals

Signals can have the following appearance:

- high (line at the top)
- low (line at the bottom)
- unknown (line in the middle)
- random (lines at top and bottom with text in between)
