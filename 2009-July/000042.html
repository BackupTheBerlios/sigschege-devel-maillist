Hi guys,

Am Thursday 02 July 2009 22:02:59 schrieb Development discussions:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't do this all in python! For a scripting interface in an  
</I>&gt;<i> application I would rater use QScript or LUA. QScript is some kind of  
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript and very easy to use and to integrate. On the other hand,  
</I>&gt;<i> LUA is also easy, powerful but simple. BUT in someway complicated to  
</I>&gt;<i> use with C++ but not impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> I used LUA as an stand-alone interpreter and wrote extensions/ 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries (in native C) for it to interface with some hardware  
</I>&gt;<i> components.
</I>&gt;<i> QScipt will be my favorite if the Qt framework will be used!
</I>
Actually the Python-Interface was not meant as a scripting interface inside the GUI, but as a separate UI.
(You know, like a GUI, but without the &quot;G&quot; part :P). The original plans had 2 binaries: A Python binary as first one
(which already exists and is even somewhat usable) and a GUI binary as secondary step.

Now that the focus is shifted the Python binary either will be omitted or be shifted to a lower priority. the
question is, if we want to have a scripting interface in the GUI. I wouldn't mind having one, but I also wouldn't
put a high priority on it. (If at all, I would only start implementing it after 1.0.)

From the  old plan I have compiled a draft for a new schedule. Please give me feedback and more suggestions.
Maybe we should put it in the Wiki?

And before we have more discussions without results: Qt is decided.

cya,
Ulf
