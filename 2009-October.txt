Hi Ingo,

I'm going to add new/load/save/saveAs stuff now, starting with the GUI entries, and moving on to the XML stuff.

So stay out of may way! ;)

Cheers,
Ulf

Hi Ulf!

It's cool! Go ahead and have some fun :-)

Can you create a task and assign it to your self? Add also task that should be 
done in future. This way everyone can see which tasks exists and which is 
still free :-) Otherwise we have to keep track in emails.

By the way. Is there any specific reason, why you use ?load? instead of ?open??

Cheers
Ingo

Done.

To make it compatible to Excel. :P
No, serious, I will change it.

You might have noticed that I have added a preliminary document-is-modified detection.
This still has some flaws:

- can't handle autosave
- can't handle undo/redo

Autosave would be easy to handle, but undo won't. There could be several approaches:

a: use current solution with autosave support added, screw undo detection

b: regard as modified if undo stack is non-empty or a undo-stack-exceeded flag is set 
This has the disadvantage that it requires the undo stack to be deleted on save.

c: create an internal xml file and calculate a checksum
Could consume too much cpu time...

d: ?

Cheers
Ulf

We call QUndoStack::setClean() every time when we save the document. Then we 
can use QundoStack::cleanChanged() slot to set the ismodified flag.

Problem solved :-)

I will start to implement addEvent etc. I don't think that this will conflict 
much with your changed.

Cheers
Ingo
